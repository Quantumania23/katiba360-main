Typography

Headings: Montserrat (bold weight for prominence) Body: Open Sans (excellent readability across screen sizes) Monospace elements: Ubuntu Mono (for code examples in API documentation) Ensure minimum 16px font size for body text Maintain 1.5 line height minimum for readability

Iconography

Use consistent line weight (2px) for all interface icons Icons should be simple, recognizable silhouettes Include tooltip explanations for all non-standard icons Ensure all icons have appropriate ARIA labels Use animation sparingly and purposefully in interactive icons

Accessibility

Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum across all interfaces Ensure color is never the only indicator of meaning Provide text alternatives for all non-text content Design for keyboard navigation with visible focus states Test all interfaces with screen readers before implementation

Responsive Behavior

Design mobile-first with progressive enhancement Create specific optimizations for feature phones common in rural Kenya Ensure touch targets minimum 44Ã—44px on mobile Simplify navigation on smaller screens without removing functionality Test on low-end devices to ensure performance

Animation Guidelines

Keep animations subtle and purposeful Ensure all animations can be disabled via reduced motion settings Use transition durations of 200-300ms for UI elements Reserve longer animations (500ms) for celebratory moments Maintain consistent easing functions across similar interactions
